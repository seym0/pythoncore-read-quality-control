# pythoncore-read-quality-control
<p> This is a training project from Hyperskill's Python core course written in python that eats three .gz archives with FASTQ data and processes them. Processing includes: <br><br>
- Reads in the file <br>
- Reads sequence average length <br>
- Repeats <br>
- Reads with Ns <br>
- Ns per read sequence <br>
- GC content average <br><br>
Also added three .gz archives from Hyperskill that I used
